_Introduction_

Rome threw off Etruscan rule about 510 BC

Alexander's Mediterranean possessions were almost precisely the lands that later became the early Byzantine Empire

Largest kingdom left to his marshals was founded by Seleucus I the Victor in Mesopotamia and extended to Syria and Anatolia: became the Seleucid Kingdom

Richest was founded in Egypt my Ptolemy I the Savior: became the Kingdom of Ptolemies

Weakest state was founded by descendants of Antigonus I the One-Eyed, Antigonid Kingdom (consisted of Macedon and a precarious and partial hegemony over Greece)

Other Greek cities and leagues also existed (Pergamum and Rhodes most powerful)

Rome absorbed Greek regions mostly peacefully without disturbing machinery of Greek rule; annexed Egypt in 30 BC (after which it became effectively a monarchy itself) annd Augustus replaced Ptolemies' agents witth his own

Latin was the language of the army & some high Roman officials who also spoke Greek; otherwise, most administrative functions, tax collection etc, were performed by Greek-speaking city councils. Culture was in Greek; most Greeks acknowledged superiority of Roman government.

Christ ministered under Augustus's successor Tiberius when Greek culture and Roman governance were dominant in East. Though Roman gov. executed him, Pete and Paul, no systematic attempt to suppress Christianity happened until the 3rd century.

By the time of the 2 persecutions, nearly every Greek city had a Christian community. Christian theology was written primarily in Greek.

By late 3rdd century neitthher Christianity, Hellenism, nor (even) the Roman Empirre wass preciseelly triumphantt in the Eeasst.

- Christians were still outnumbered and particularly sparse in the countryside
- Even Greeks were a minority, where Greek was spoken only on the peninsula and W. Anatolia and islands, etc. (Egypt was Coptic, Syria and Mesopotamia were Aramaic, Thrace, Thracian; several languages inside Anatolia)

Causes of Roman loss of eastern provinces in late 2nd and 3rd centuries:

- epidemic
- Parthians invaded from east
- Germans invaded from north
  - emperors began raising army's pay
- disease caused decline in taxpaying population
  - couldn't pay army payroll
- government debased and overminted currency and inflation set in
- military annoyed by sinking value of pay
  - military revolts begin

Goths (German tribal alliance) invaded Thrace, Greece, Anatolia - Romans forced to evacuate Dacia (modern Romania north of Danube)

Sassanid Persians (replaced Parthians in 226) also harassed Syria and took over Roman protectorate in Armenia

Arabs of Palmyra repudiated Roman suzerainty and temporarily ruled Syria, Egypt, part of Anatolia

Commanders fighting all these rebels often tried to seize power themselves

Between 211 and 284, Goths killed one emperor, Persians captured another, a third died in an epidemic, but remaining 23 were certainly or probably killed by Romans

After 284, major reforms mark beginning of Byzantine period - administrative division between East and West

Though West disappeared, East gained and lost territory, declined and recovered

- moderate loss between 300 and 450 due to defeats from Persians and Huns
- major gain occured when much of West reconquered by Justinian
- Justinian's gains disappeared by 620 because of fresh invasions of Germans, Persians, and Avars
- 750 another major loss to Arabs
- by 1050, most of these losses made good
- then another severe decline due to Seljuk Turks
- decline lasted til 1204 when Constantinople fell to the Fourth Crusade
- Provinces that remained under Greek rule divided among several successor states
- Main empire and smaller Greek states shrank to nothing by 1461, conquered by the Ottoman Turks

Above is unpromising, but eastern Roman Empire retained much prosperity by late 3rd century

- invasions and requisitions caused only local/temporary impoverishment
- recurrences of disease brought moderate depopulation only and relieved some overpopulation
- commerce, manufacturing, culture of E. Roman cities still impressive

Worst effects of 3rd century crisis felt in West

- less defensible frontiers
- less productive cities
- more enemy raids and revolts

**Enlarged State and Burdened Society**

**Chapter One: The Refoundation of the Empire, 284-337**

283, Emperor Carus killed during war against Persians in Mesopotamia (allegedly by thunderbolt, probably by assassination)

Roman army proclaimed Carus's son Numerian emperor

Soon abandoned war, withdrew into Anatolia

Army reaches Nicomedia 284

- Diocles (commander of the imperial bodyguard), announced Numerian had been assassinated
- Diocles executes supposed assassin, proclaims himself emperor
- Carus's surviving son, Carinus, rejects claim; had been ruling at Rome and now leads army against Diocles
- Civil war begins, early next year 2 emperors clash at the Margus River in the middle of the Balkans
- Battle going well for Carinus until he is assassinated, Diocles temporarily the only undisputed ruler of the Roman Empire

_Diocletian's New System_

Diocletian a middling general but excellent manager (from obscure family in Illyricam)
Better than average education
Probably born in Salona
Father was freedman and scribe
Diocletian liked records and numbers, wrote well
Salona was in Latin-speaking territory, but his Greek name suggest Greek origin (he spoke both languages)
In 285 he latinized his name to Diocletianus

Had no son, but decided another emperor was needed to share powers and dangers

In July 285, he adopted an Illyrian comrade, Maximian, as his son and gave him the rank Caesar (junior emperor)

Defense of provinces west of Illyricum became primary responsibility of Maximian; Illyricum and the East remained to Diocletian

Maximian promoted by Diocletian to Augustus (highest imperial rank) the next year when Maxiamian faced a usurping emperor in Britain

Diocletian kept formal precedence over Maximian, styling himself Jovius (patronage from Jupiter, king of gods); he titled Maximian Herculius (assigning him the patronage of Jupiter's son Hercules)

Maximian deferred to Diocletian's judgment but each man had his own court, army, administration and praetorian prefect as chief lieutenant.

Diocletian's probable considerations for choosing to rule the East:

- East, w/ Illyricum, at least as important as West
- 23 of 34 legions were in the East (because of threat of Persia)
- Illyricum was best recruiting ground
- Egypt was richest farmland

Diocletian concentrated on strengthening frontiers of East

- recruited more troops
- drove Sarmatian raider back across Danube
  - built new fortifications to keep them out
- in 287, negotiated peace w/ Persia, established protectorate over Armenia, securing Mesopotamian border
- established principal residence at Nicomedia (midway bweteen Balkan and Mesopotamian frontiers)

Diocletian felt that empire (incl West) needed bigger army & fortification

- in 287 introduced new system of tax and requisition
  - inflation of the previous century had required requisitions of labor or goods
  - inflation also affected this requisition system
- Diocletian standardized tax and requisitions based on ability to pay
  - introced the _caput_, a theoretical unit for identifying varying numbers of taxpayers
    - represented a set amount of wealth, so could be one rich person or several poor households
    - seems limited to real estate wealth
  - introduced the _jugum_ ("yoke), representing a set acreage of first-class plowland
    - could represent a set acreage of worse land or smaller portion of better land
  - required caput and jugum varied year to year with gov. needs
- system took time to put into place, but allowed an accurate census to be made
- Diocletian revised assessments in 5 year cycles starting 287
